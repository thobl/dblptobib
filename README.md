# publist

Load list of papers from [dblp](https://dblp.org/) and output them in
bibtex and html.

## Usage

Edit the `papers` variable in [update.py](update.py) to include the
dblp ids of the papers you want to include.

Then, running `./update.py` fetches information from dblp and creates
the output in [output/](output/).
